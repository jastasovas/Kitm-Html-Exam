        <h2>There's a Place in France ...</h2>
        <h3>Frankfurt Airport</h3>
        <p>
          I'm on a four-hour layover waiting for my connection to Marseille,
          mindlessly following signs, mindlessly following crowds. Occasionally
          the crowds bunch into queues, queues for shuttles, queues for
          information, queues for coffee. I've come to accept the dozens of
          communication failures that happen daily when I'm traveling abroad. My
          first of this trip came when I summoned my best German to order coffee
          mit cream and got a cup of thick black ink instead. On the flight I
          watched a documentary about how we fail to appreciate the miracle of
          modern aviation. (No doubt produced by some airline consortium.) Each
          gate in an airport should be seen as a portal, the film suggested, a
          portal that allows us to step from London to Abu Dhabi, from Montreal
          to Lima, from Shanghai to Honolulu. The film didn't mention the
          zombifying effect this "miracle" has on travelers. There's an old
          Bedouin saying about how the soul should never travel faster than a
          camel can walk. My soul was still in San Francisco.

        <h3>Saint Remy de Provence</h3>
        <p>
          For several months my girlfriend Pam and her wine club friends had
          been pressuring me to join them on a three-week tour of France. The
          trip had been in the works for a year. Bart and Lesley were the
          unofficial organizers, this would be a nostalgic return to some of
          their favorite haunts. But really the itinerary grew out of dozens of
          emails between the group members-- Dana and Michele, wine connoisseurs
          from LA who knew France well, mellow Neil and hyper Carolyn, who were
          up for anything, Gen and Kevin, a younger couple from South Carolina
          who were friends of Bart and Lesley's but whom no one else knew, and
          Pam, the only member lacking a plus-one. I didn't want to go. I spent
          most of June in Europe and I was in Europe twice last year. I was sick
          of Europe. Every quaint village looks the same to me— old castle, old
          church, old bridge over some river. Also, group travel has never been
          my thing, especially a group like this one with so many alpha
          personalities. And wine tasting? Sure, I like wine, I like all wine,
          but that's the problem, to be a true wine appreciator one must not
          like some wine. And staying in villas? I subscribe to the motto of
          Lonely Planet—To get to know a place you have to be prepared to spend
          less. (I wonder if that's still their motto.) Three weeks before
          departure my last excuse fell through. I bought a ticket. And now here
          I was with Walid, groping in the dark, trying to locate some Villa
          called Domaine des Cyprès. I gave up and called Pam.

        <h3>Dear All</h3>
        <p>
          I bade farewell to lovely Knysna this morning, to continue my Road
          Trip eastwards along South Africa's famous Garden Route. There were so
          many places I could have stopped off at, it became difficult to
          choose. For this part of my adventure, I narrowed it down to firstly a
          stop at the Storms River Bridge in the Tsitsikamma National Park, a
          120m high concrete arch bridge looming over a seriously stunning and
          high river canyon formed by the Storms River flowing deep down below.
          I'm not one to suffer greatly from vertigo, but walking across it and
          peering over the side seriously induced some knee-knocking moments for
          me. With a bit more time I would have loved to have explored the
          nearby village of Storms River by the coast. I didn't realise it but
          also, just a few miles before the Storms River bridge to its west is
          the Bloukrans Bridge, almost twice its height at 216 metres and
          actually home to one of the world's highest bungee jumps.
        </p>
        <h3>After this was a stop ..</h3>
        <p>
          After taking some advice from a fellow traveller back in Knysna, and
          also my next accommodation owner, I avoided taking the navigation
          advice given on my Here We Go app as this would have taken me through
          some dodgy northern townships of PE such as New Brighton and
          Bethelsdorp. They had both advised me instead to travel to a village
          about 15 miles further east along the coast called Colchester, and
          pick up the route from there. What I unfortunately failed to find out
          was that

        <h2>Seram Island & Ora Beach Travel Guide</h2>
        <h3>How To Get To Seram Island</h3>
        <p>
          Seram island is located near the busy island of Ambon in Maluku,
          Indonesia. Getting there is quite a journey, with several steps
          involved. Currently there’s no active airport in Seram island, so you
          can’t fly there yet. The nearest airport is Pattimura International
          Airport in Ambon (AMQ), which has direct flights from Jakarta,
          Makassar, Ternate, Sorong, and other places in Indonesia. You can shop
          for flights on Skyscanner. Once you arrive in Ambon, you’ll need a
          taxi for the 1 hour drive from the airport to the ferry port in
          Tulehu. Here, you’ll catch a fast ferry to Amahai port on Seram
          island. The boats are old, but comfortable, and take about 2 hours to
          get to Amahai.

        <h3>Where To Stay In Seram Island</h3>
        <p>
          There are a bunch of new guesthouses in the Ora bay area that are high
          rated, budget friendly, and relatively comfortable.This is a very
          remote part of Indonesia, so don’t expect luxury, but the comfort
          level is surprisingly good for something this isolated. Here are some
          of your best options: Ora Sunrise View — Overwater bungalows in
          Saleman village, with overwater hammocks. They were closed for
          renovation when we visited Seram in 2021, otherwise this hotel would
          have been our first choice. The rooms have a fan, clothes rack, and
          electric socket, and the bathrooms have a basic toilet and shower. Air
          Belanda Resort — Beachfront bungalows on the ‘Dutch water beach,’ with
          a dining room and hammock. The rooms have a balcony, window, fan,
          electric socket, and a nice jungle background. The bathroom has a
          basic toilet, shower, and sink. Nusa Nalan Beach Resort — Beachfront
          bungalows near Saleman village. The rooms have a fan, mirror, TV, and
          socket, and the bathrooms have a basic shower and toilet. Sing Key
          Beach Hotel — Beachfront bungalows near Saleman village. The rooms
          have a fan, window, socket, and clothes rack, and the bathrooms have a
          basic sink, shower, and toilet.

        <h2>Antelope Canyon Tours: Which Is Best?</h2>
        <h3>Best Antelope Canyon Tours</h3>
        <p>
          We booked our Antelope Canyon tours with GetYourGuide and had a great
          experience. The price includes your entry tickets and a Navajo local
          guide. Everything was communicated clearly by email, and they have a
          refund policy if you need to cancel in advance. We’ve used
          GetYourGuide for lots of tours and activities around the world, and
          they’re great. Highly recommended!
        </p>
        <h3>Best Time To Visit Antelope Canyon</h3>
        <p>
          The best time to visit Antelope Canyon is generally from the end of
          March to the beginning of October. This is especially true for the
          Upper Antelope Canyon, that way you can see the famous light beams.
          These are best seen between 10:30 AM and 1:30 PM, on a cloudless
          summer day when the sun is high in the sky. For the Lower Canyon, the
          opposite is true. This canyon gets a lot more ambient light from the
          sun, so the best time of day to visit it is actually in the morning or
          late afternoon, when there’s not too much light. However, we went to
          Lower Canyon in the middle of the day and I have to say most parts of
          the canyon were still very nice even at that time, so don’t write off
          a midday visit completely. For Canyon X, any time of day is good to
          visit. We went in the afternoon and it was great. The slots have some
          areas that are deep, and others that are shallow, so it can be
          beautiful and photogenic in a variety of lighting conditions. For all
          of the slot canyons in Arizona, if you want to avoid the crowds, the
          best time to go is from November to March. However, the lighting and
          colors won’t be nearly as dramatic or beautiful at this time, so it’s
          not quite the same experience. I wouldn’t even bother with the Upper
          Antelope Canyon at all in the winter months, because it’s just too dim
          at that time.
